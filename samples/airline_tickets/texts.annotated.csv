2003,"Here is a little story for you `football``SK`´ fans out there.

Couple of weeks ago My wife and I decide to book a flight to `Memphis``SN``TO`´ Feb1 to Feb3, to meet up with relatives. Personally I didnt want to go. Now, we all know that Feb3 is the `superbowl``SK`´. I told my wife I was cool with coming home Feb3. I am a NY Giants fan and no one out there including myself(die hard fan) didnt think that the Giant would ever make it to the `superbowl``SK`´.

OK, we are flying back Feb3 not too bad right? WRONG!!! Our flight is during the game. AHHH! So i decide to try to `change the flight``PK``changing flight`´ to earlier time.

Well, online they wanted to `charge me``PK``fees`´ $300 to change my flight to leave 3 hours earlier. So I figured that I will call them and maybe they can reason with me.

Well, I called and waited 30 minutes to talk to someone and they told me the same thing $300. I told them it was highway robbery. I can understand why for changing times. I t makes more sense to penalize you if you `canceled``PK``cancellation`´ or if you changed carriers, but not for changeing times.

I dont think its right. There are many companies to choose from and I choose them. You would think a little help would be nice from them. What if there was an emergency at home? What are they going to `charge me``PK``fees`´ $300 for that too.

Sorry, but I'm just `frustrated``SK`´ and I dont think it is fair for paying customers to pay a penalty to changes the times of their flight.

Back to the `superbowl``SK`´ issue... I am planning to do standby in case we get lucky. I will also record the game so I can watch it when I get home that night. I will have to not listen to the radio or look at an TVs before getting home.

So therefore NWA `is not cool``SK`´ and I wil `not choose them again``SK`´. And wish me luck on being able to watch he game. ----",,True

We fly from `Toronto``SN``FROM`´ in Canada. We have tried it with a few on different trips and get very different experiences. From Toronto `Air Canada``SN``AIRLINE`´ and `Transat``SN``AIRLINE`´ seem to have a 12 hour window ahead that you can check your `seats``PK``seating`´ and move them (at no `cost``PK``fees`´) and put in your `passport``SK`´ details to speed up your airport experience.

With both of them the process seems to work fairly smoothly with a separate line at the airport for those who have done it and maybe a few minutes quicker at the actual check in with your cases.

`Cubana``SN``AIRLINE`´ did not have this service the last time we used it. `Sunwing``SN``AIRLINE`´ only had a 4 hour window which considering you have to be at the airport 3 hours ahead doesn't leave much time and for some people it just can't be done (we now live further from the airport and fall into that category).

The last time we did use this at the airport they had kiosks that if you hadn't already done it on line they had you use, then everyone was still put into one large line for the actual suitcase check in - so it did not on that day seem to be any quicker. Granted that day we went `Sunwing``SN``AIRLINE`´ had about 4 flights going out within a short period of time of each other all checking in at the same desks.",Complaint/Feedback,True

We're looking at going to Cancun next May (2015) from London Gatwick. The cheapest deal we've found is via Expedia as part of a hotel+flight deal - the flights are with Virgin Airlines and this deal works out about £200 cheaper overall than any other way we've so far found.

Has anyone booked through Expedia for a long haul flight such as this? Did you have any problems with the airline not having the booking (or the hotel for that matter?!)

I have posted my Mothers email below so you are able to see what they experienced. Firstly though the check in was terrible, rude and condescening and had to deal with 3 different people all with a different take. The series of events below are not all personally BA's fault but their obvious lack of management of people paying to travel on their service is unbelievable.

My Father has also flown on BA from Auckland to London via Asia and had his own experiences where his seat would not stay up and was told off by a flight attendant for not putting it up for landing and when he told them about it they did nothing - it is actually illegal for them to have a passenger seated in a seat that does not stay up for landing and take off but they did nothing, when he got back on the plane after the transit they still had not done anything and he still had to sit in that seat?????

Personally I am a member of Star Alliance and flew over 70,000 miles last year to various places around the globe and didn't experience anything like this......

Extract from my Mothers email:

Yes we did make it home but it was the flight from hell!!. Of course ready to go and they cancelled due to plane being hit by lightening. Found another plane and announced at 6.00 that it was ready. Everyone lined up at the gate then my name was called out to go to the front. Took my bag and pull on with me but discovered Kuku had my cell phone in his bag.

it ended up I had been random selected to have a full search along with about 20 others. Once this was done they loaded me with the others selected onto a bus, closed the doors and left us siting out on the tarmac for another hour. Noone came near the bus to communicate what was happening and of course unable to contact Kuku to let him know.

Finally bused to the plane and took of about 7.30. 3.5 hours late.

'The nightmare really began when we got to LA. Had to line up to go through the Visa section told the guy we had a connecting flight and he said we had heaps of time to just stay where we were. Collected our bags finally to find we had to go through customs with the line a mile long. Explained again our flight was nearly due to go and they said ""just stay in the line"".(not even a transit line)

When we finally got through there was no one or any signs to tell us where to go but found someone who said terminal 4 which was outside and a few down. Went through another check where a guy said with a smile your'e going to miss the plane. Raced forward and in the final check an official said ""take your cabin bags and leave your bags with me and run"". Raced down the terminal as they were calling Kuku's and my name and arrived at the gate as they guy was signing off and saying we had not arrived. Said into the phone ""they are here... change that"". We got on as they were saying doors were closed and we were ready to go.

The flight was great but of course when we arrived in Auckland no bags and when enquired the lady seemed surprised that they had not sent word that the bags were following. We were going to go and check on Zazu but after the experience felt cold, tired and exhausted and came straight home.

I have been checking with Air NZ baggage who manage lost bags and the status is still ""tracing"".

2055,"Fear of flying is something many travelers -- or would-be travelers -- have to deal with. Statistically air travel is quite safe. And fear of flying can be overcome easily. Fear of flying can exhibit itself in a wide range of feelings depending on the individual -- everything from being simply uneasy about getting on an airplane to a serious, crippling phobia of air travel. It is also sometimes referred to as aviatophobia, aviophobia, or pteromerhanophobia. Commercial flight has become an important, even essential, part of modern life; yet flying continues to cause a significant proportion of the public to feel anxiety. Fear of flying seems to contradict the facts; for example, driving in an automobile is statistically many times more dangerous.

Frankly, I find I have a much greater fear of taxi drivers with an obvious ""death wish"" careening recklessly through heavy traffic on the way to an airport, than I do of any air trip I'm about to undertake. Does the thought of flying make you feel a little shaky? Or is your reaction more extreme -- you feel panicky and frequently find ways to avoid airplane trips?

The fear of flying is common with a range of severities. There are many treatment programs available, some even run by airlines. Whether you fear a crash or hate being confined to a crowded plane, there is hope. A Google search for 'fear of flying' brings up a huge number of interesting websites: http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=navclient&ie=UTF-8&rls=GGIH,GGIH:2007-02,GGIH:en&q=fear+of+flying

I've never myself experienced any real fear of air travel and I've traveled extensively. But I've known many people with varying degrees of it. Over quite a few years of traveling to many places I've even had the scary misfortune of finding myself in a couple of ""emergency landing"" scenarios which happily resulted in no serious mishap. . But thinking back on those I realize they never gave me a fear of air travel after the fact. It'd be interesting to hear the comments of both other people who don't fear flying -- and others who are dealing with it.

1648,"On March 12th SAS sent our checked in (in Birmingham) luggage on the flight after ours from Copenhagen to Oslo-no explanation, no apology, but it did at least eventually arrive.And they knew where it was.

As we were staying at an airport hotel it was no big deal and we shrugged it off-we travel a lot and this has never happened to either of us before. We got back to Birmingham last night-one of our (2) checked- in bags did not. They don't know where it is , which I find slightly worrying,not least because airlines are supposedly so hot on security.

I realise it won't be classed as 'lost' until after 21 days . And as we are now home this may seem relatively unimportant and I appreciate it could be worse. But the said bag contains all our thermal underwear, a fleece( all especially purchased for the holiday) and 8 heavy- duty cotton shirts belonging to my husband, as well as thick sweaters, trousers etc .

Given the present freezing weather in the UK, we could do with these items . Would I be justified in asking the airline for fairly immediate partial compensation ? Even if it does eventually turn up-and there have been two flights from Copenhagen today so I'm not hopeful- am I entitled to some redress for the delay in such circumstances?

We do have good travel insurance, with only a £35 excess, which would compensate us to the full value (approximately £1500 including the case itself, which is new and expensive). Should I just forget the airline and go straight to them?

Out of curiosity does anyone know what happens if they compensate you and the case turns up? There are a couple of items which have some sentimental, if not monetary, value which I cannot replace and would really like back (a mirrored compact and an engraved hip flask containing whiskey, neither of which I could put in my hand luggage-I'm just glad our walking boots were in there) I would add that the said case while large and black does have a bright pink strap around it with our name on it, plus address labels inside and out...

BA say it is not their problem as the flight was operated by Iberia and that I should complain to them. I had understood that EU legislation and even UK legislation existed to make the Marketing airline equally liable for such matters.

Can you please advise me on this?

Secondly – I followed EXACTLY what both BA and the local agent (Iberia) in Santo Domingo told me to do including to travel to the airport in SD to pick up my delayed luggage when it finally arrived and BA are also telling me that they wont reimburse the taxi fare incurred despite my taking the taxi at Iberia’s instruction. They now say that I should have just waited and purchased any necessary items for which they would have reimbursed me.

Iberia told me to pick the bags up as

1) They had failed to deliver them at the time they promised,
2) I was leaving the hotel then and touring with no fixed location for some 6 weeks and therefore there was no other possibility to reunite me with my baggage,
3) my baggage contained many items including essential prescription medication which was unobtainable in the Dominican Republic and without which I would have had to fly home early and therefore would have had a much more substantial claim against the airline and so under my obligation to “mitigate the airlines loss” I traveled to the airport (which was also what they told me to do) to pick up my bags in person.

I noticed that the World Traveller seat is listed as 31inch seat pitch, but when I tried to search for the seat pitch and leg room stats for the World Traveller Plus on BA.com to compare just what I get in return for the higher price I could not find the stats, just some vague reference to increased seat recline.

I would prefer to book the WT+ if I could just find a better fare. The best price I could find being on the BA.com website for the WT+ at around $4200 all-in price, and the best economy flight is just over $1500 all-in round trip on a discount website located in Canada.

My travel dates are Jan8th YUL-LHR-BKK. Return Feb10 BKK-LHR-YUL, and those dates are some what flex.

I am interested in booking BA because it has only one stop that is so appealing to me, with Air France the only other airline that would have only one stop (CDG) and the fact that I would be on the same carrier on both legs decreasing the chance of lost luggage.

2399,"Hi all,

I'm not a very seasoned traveller, back in May I went to Berlin but this was my first trip in about 15 years. Next month I'm travelling again, but this time alone, and I have a few questions if some of you lovely people can take the time to answer them for me?

My first question, in May I travelled with Ryanair, they were very specific that the information I entered on the system matched exactly, especially my passport number. This time I'm travelling with KLM, and although I've filled in my advanced traveller information, they haven't asked for my passport number at all. Is this normal?

Second question. I'm taking a connecting flight in Amsterdam, my first time doing this too! When I disembark from the first flight, I don't have to pass through security? I'm assuming that for flight connections there will be sign posts, and you go to a different part of the airport?

And lastly, checking in. On the way out I will print out my boarding pass, and I'm not taking hold luggage. So, does this mean once I pass through security I can just wait for my flight to board? Or do I have to do something else? And another (ok, it wasn't the last question!), on the return leg I think will try the mobile boarding pass. Is this just a case of having it sent to your phone, and then showing them your screen when you board?

Is is still an available possibility (at no cost) on most airlines? We probably would be going Delta/KLM or Air France.

And if it is still possible, is there any online way to specify this stopover period, in order to check available flights & costs? I have looked at the multicity possibility online but it prices the trip significantly higher than a straight round trip.

2121,"Okay, let's start with basics: Solo traveller, mid-twenties, not first time o/s but first time solo. Flying Qantas CBR -> LAX return (one itinerary), duration of stay in US approx four weeks. (Mid March-April 2016). Flying Delta for all internal US flights (all booked as a multi-city on one ticket). ESTA/travel insurance all sorted.

Now, the questions:

- Qantas have given me 2hrs 5minutes in Sydney to go from Domestic to International. I plan to use the Qantas transfer between terminals but I admit to being a little nervous about this lack of time. My bag will be checked through to LAX at CBR, I'll be landing in SYD at 0925 and taking off again at 1130, is this going to be enough time?

- QF11 lands in LAX at 0625 local time (on the same day, a Friday), and my first Delta flight (LAX -> SLC -> COS) is at 1030. I should be perfectly fine with this layover, right? I plan to buy a Delta Sky Club day pass and have a shower, but obviously would skip the shower if not enough time.

- Hate to sound like a stereotypical Australian, but - VEGEMITE. I would declare it in any case, but will a tube of Vegemite get through customs? Or would it get confiscated? I'll also have Australian chocolates/biscuits etc for American friends. These are okay, right? I've sent them by post before.

- Figure skates. I have them, I love them, they're worth a lot of money, I plan to do some serious skating while in the US. TSA website and USFS website assure me skates can go in carry-on for US domestic, and I have the printout. Should I expect delays at security with my skates in my carry-on?

- Delta's website says that check-in closes 45 minutes before the flight except at certain airports. I can't find COS on that list - will I be okay arriving at COS airport at 0530 for a 0630 flight?

- Finally, on the way out, how long should I allow for outbound security, immigration etc at LAX? My flight is not until 2215, I plan on arriving at the airport at 1800-ish, do you think that will be sufficient time or should I try for earlier?

Sorry for all the questions, but I am a bit of a worrywart and this is one of those trip-of-a-lifetime things for me.

Flight Centre are adamant that my electronically signed invoice confirms I checked all names before ticketing. I have a couple of issues with this:

2294,"This is more of a hypothetical enquiry, as I am not planning to fly in the near future (unfortunately!), but I am wondering and figured you experts would be able to shed some light on this.

I can see the advantages of OLCI, especially when flying without checked baggage, and/or when flying with a LCC who charges for printing boarding passes at the airport.

However, I for some reason feel rather ""insecure"" when thinking about OLCI. I've always viewed checking in as a way for the airline to know you are at the airport, which can be useful information, no? While they won't hold the flight for you, I'm thinking of the airlines calling the names of people who are late for the flight, you know ""Mr. Smith, please go to gate XX for boarding"", etc.

So if you've done OLCI (and didn't have any luggage to check), the airline wouldn't know that you are in the airport, and could be wasting their time/breath calling you? Not that this has any significance in the long run, just wondering.

Also, I'm thinking back on a previous flying experience, when I checked-in at the airport, and wondering what would've happened if I'd done OLCI instead (and let's imagine for the purposes of this post that I didn't have any luggage to check-in).

I was flying United Airlines, YQB-EWR-TXL. When we arrived for check-in at the airport (3 hours in advance as any good international traveler should) we found out at the check-in counter that our YQB-EWR flight was delayed by about 5 hours, which would consequently make us miss our EWR-TXL flight. The check-in agent then proceeded to book us on other flights to get us to TXL.

When/how would this have been addressed, then? Maybe then I would've experienced that infamous ""horrible"" service from UA? Any insights from you expert travelers who always use OLCI?

I was travelling with two large suitcases and one of them never showed up. I waited at the airport for more than 6 hours and then had to leave because I didn't want to miss the bus again. And also since I'm studying abroad right now (not on holiday), the suitcase that's missing has a lot of essential items. Pretty much my entire autumn and winter wardrobe including bedding.

I bought some essential items and filled out the Baggage Compensation Form about 2 weeks ago and never heard back. I called BA and they told me I can only deal with Claims through email.

I emailed them and no one has emailed me back. I dealt with BA through social media and they told me I can only email the Claims department.

Got some very realistic answered last time I posted, so I will try again. :)

I am a full time graduate student and totally on a budget, while I am busy doing school stuff, I was dreaming of going away with my family to some place over the Thanksgiving break. (2 adults, 3 kids).

I have off from the 18th to the 31st of Nov, but obviously can't afford to be gone that long, even something as short as 3 nights, would be nice.

I know Thanksgiving is like the extreme travel days, but I was wondering if there is ever any valid last minute deals during this period at all?? (Wouldn't mind traveling on the actual day at all.)

We could go at super short notice, we don't care where we go at all, anywhere would be fine. 

Another big problem would probably be that our closest airport is SLC, which sucks for pricing!

I feel cheated by airasia and airasia is misusing my Money. Recommendation here not to take AIRASIA for any of trip, I did this booking on May 19, Y4UNJR for Bangkok. I cancelled this booking in the first week of June because of on going condition (Curfrew) in Bangkok that time.

Concerns are..

1. I insisted to send the money back in my credit card. that was NOT done as per SO CALLED AIR ASIA POLICY.Had been given credit of 339 SGD in my air asia account 7840053045 for my flight booking.

2. Today I want to do the booking for the month of Sep using this amount but another AIR ASIA POLICY is that I can not do Flight+HOTEL booking using this amount. I can do only flight booking with this amount. WHY AIR ASIA FORGETTING “THIS IS MY MONEY”.

3. Call center executive told me to do flight booking using this amount, Bangkok return flight will cost approx 200 SGD max , what will I do with remaining 139SGD? I can not do hotel booking either.

4. If I am doing separate booking that will cost me more. And not even that I can not use this 139SGD for that.

5. CALL Center executive even suggested to wait till fares go up and use this amount then and end up paying MORE , WHAT a Disgusting suggesting and to make customer fool

6. Air ASIA can not do refund for the remaining balance amount of 139SGD to my account as per their policy and cant use the amount for hotel booking

7. I have not received my hotel booking cancellation amount till now in my credit card. This is clear case of CHEATING BY AIR ASIA and Playing with customer money.

2089,"I've been shopping around on Skyscanner a long-haul flight, and as many of you may know, the price can differ dramatically depending on which country you leave from.

I'm in the UK, but I was open to taking a low-cost flight to a third country if it worked out cheaper. The best flight I found starts in a third country, but then goes *via* the UK.

I looked up just the portion of the trip starting in the UK, and it was almost a third more expensive again. So I thought– what if I just booked the whole trip, but just show up at the UK airport, and start with the 'second' leg?

Each leg is with a different airline– the long-haul flight is wih Virgin, and the connecting third-country flights are with BA.

I checked the T&C on the ticketing website (not an airline), and it says that you must use tickets consecutively, and missing one leg means subsequent legs will be cancelled. However, as far as I can see, BA and Virgin don't codeshare, and it's hard to see how Virgin would know if I didn't get on my BA flight a few hours earlier.

Am I being naïve, or could I do this?

I know it doesn't seem quite legit, but seems like everyone wins– I get my cheap long haul, the ticket company and airlines get their money, and BA gets a lighter flight than they planned for (or the overbooked passengers get a seat). On the other hand, it's a very important trip, and I don't want to risk losing it. Any clarity/certainty would be appreciated– especially from someone who may have done this before.

2225,"Hello Everyone!

I’m hoping for a bit of advice with regard to refundable vs. non-refundable flights, and how travel insurance might factor in the decision.

I am shopping for fares to book a roundtrip ticket for a trip in which I’m planning to be away for about three months this summer. The exact date of my early August departure (or November return for that matter) isn’t terribly sensitive, and as I don’t forsee any scheduling issues this far in advance, I’ll likely select travel dates on which I can find the best rates. But as I’ve got just a tinge of worry that something important might arise forcing me to change (or even worse cancel) my trip unexpectedly, I have been comparing refundable fares as well.

I’m astonished at the difference! A basic non-refundable fare from Baltimore/Washington area airports to CDG is in the area of 1,200 to 1,400 US. Compare that to the refundable fares, with the same dates and carriers, at around 3,300 – 3,500 US!!

Is such a drastic increase usual? I was expecting a few/several hundred diff., but 2.5x the cost seems abnormal!

Now I should also note that in addition to my flight arrangements, I’ve also been researching travel insurance policies, just for a bit of added peace of mind I suppose. I’ve been told that a number of such policies extend to cover flight cancellations, which I understood to mean that one would be covered in the event of an airline caused cancellation.

Can anyone confirm to what degree such policies could cover me in case of having to cancel or postpone my trip? Are there any particularly good agencies people have used and would recommend (or urge to avoid!)? Would this be a good alternative to splashing out on that oh-so-expensive refundable airfare??

Thanks for reading, and I'll look forward to your suggestions!

Long story short,I purchased two tickets from LAX-Dublin from Expedia for $650ea r/t for my wife and I about a 1 ½ years ago. Due to an illness we paid (and were charged) for changing our tickets to last month. We arrive at the airport and my wife’s ticket was changed and mine was not.

After trying to get Expedia to change the ticket in time for departure, at one hour until take-off I am forced to buy a ticket from AA at $2400. It is my belief that due to severe negligence on Expedia’s part, I was unable to secure a reasonable priced ticket and Expedia should reimburse me for the cost of the AA ticket, as all information confirming my itinerary was correct, and confirmed by phone with Expedia, basically they booked me a ticket but did not purchase it.

I called the airline to share my concern about the short time in between flights and they assured me that it was a legal connecting flight and there was enough time to connect or they wouldn't be allowed to sell the tickets. I'm not to assured tho. Lol.

Also I'm nervous about sitting apart from my family on the flights. They all seemed pretty well booked. Not sure how seating arrangements work exactly. If I arrive earlier will it increase the chances of sitting together??

2133,"I am trying to get a one way business ticket from SFO to chennai for Dec this year. This is what the agent at Emirates just told me

2. reward ticket for business 124000 miles plus 740$ taxes (cannot imagine why the taxes are almost the cost of an economy fare for a reward ticket)

2421,"Hi all,

Sorry I realise it's ""one of these"" type threads. It's likely that I'm about (i.e. first trip will be befroe the end of March) to embark on LHR <-> GRU once a month for 7 months ish (2 weeks in each destination) and I'm trying to work out which combinations of airlines and routes might be best for me, I'd appreciate opinions on the routes and FF programmes.

I am restrictred slightly by the forced usage of certain airlines/routes by my company and I can't book that far in advance (maybe 2 trips/months in advance) due to changing requirements.

Key details:

- Economy always ( damn you corporate policy! ) typically discount economy fares
- I only hold a British passport (no restrictions - i.e. I can transit the US etc)
- I have 90 tier points with BA at the moment. Membership year ends of March
- No other FF memberships of note (i.e. I have them but 0 balances)

My choices basically amount to the following combos which I can't necessarily always book due to the particular airline not being the cheapest those dates (i.e. I can't always consistently stick with one).

The corporate booking agent have various rules to list options as ""valid"" or not:
1) AA via JFK (generally only a ""valid"" option at short notice)
2) IB via MAD
3) LH via FRA or MUC
4) TAM direct
5) BA direct (very very rare that this is cheap enough to be considered - generally only cheap enough over the world cup, go figure)
6) KLM/AF via AMS/CDG (typically out one way, back the other) and an occaisional smattering of others (DL via JFK, TAP via LIS, etc).

I'm tempted to stick with OneWorld carriers as for shorthaul often my company will fly us BA and so I'd like to use this to try to get lounge access - but my BAEC account will rollover to a new membership year before I reach silver and except going consistently via JFK I'm not sure I'll get enough miles/points/etc to make the cut with other programmes.

Irritatingly TAM only switch to OneWorld at the end of March and there's no word (as far as I can see) as to what they plan to do FF programme wise.

Great, since she's got a ticket, I went onto my corporate travel site and bought my ticket. All's good, or so I thought...

Picked up my e-mail after dinner and had a message from Travelocity that they could not ticket my flight and to call an 888 number. I did that and after the requisite hold time got an Indian-sounding fellow who started explaining that Midwest and Delta don't have a codeshare agreement anymore than that I'd need to pick up my bags and transfer them between airlines.

I tried to point out that the outbound and return were on the same airline and I started to get an incomprehensible story about how it was complicated and Travelocity couldn't ticket it. Aarrghh!

Of course, fare will be part of the decision but if all fares are equal or close, then considering the plane and seat configuration plays a big role. At this point I will be in economy, although if there's a decent fare for premium econ, I may consider that.

American - via Mia, flies 767s with 2-3-2 seating. I am an Advantage member and would earn miles. Air France, via Atlanta, JFK, IAD or Detroit. Flies 777-200s, A340s or the A380. I have flown AF in the past and enjoy their service. Seating is either 2-4-2 or 3-4-3. Aer LIngus from Orlando to Dublin, then connecting to Paris. Flies A-330's, with 2-4-2 seating. US Air via CLT or PHI, in A-330s with 2-4-2 seating. Lufthansa from Orlando to FRA then connecting to Paris. Flies 747 with 3-4-3 seating.

What about the window sections with 3 seats -- would that middle seat be the last to be assigned (unless of course a couple requests it).

I could use some advice from those more experienced than myself in these matters. I'm an American citizen set to travel from the States to Europe in 4 weeks time.

The travel arrangements are rather last minute. I am recently married and just recently changed my last name. My passport is still in my ""maiden name"" (ugh, I hate that term). However, I did not totally change my surname - I simply added to it. So where I was ""Cecilia A. Wilde"" before marriage, I am now ""Cecilia A. Wilde Franco"" after marriage. Two last names, no hyphen. So technically, the first HALF of my current legal surname is still on my passport.

Do you think I can get away with this, or is it necessary to update my passport or change the name on my ticket before departure?

If I must update my documents, is there any chance at all of getting my passport back from the passport office in time, even if I expedite it?

Would I be better served updating the name on my plane ticket?

I'm planning to travel to Tel Avis, Israel from Columbus, OH in May 2015 and then return home in August after visiting here and there in Europe.

So I cross checked with BA and sure enough over £4000 ... Same like for like holiday !! But my dear OH pulled the plug... And dithered so much that six hours later, when finally.... Wam there it is .... New price..Over £4000 So have I missed out on the bargain if the year?

Would Virgin have indeed honoured the original price..??

2157,"mumathome88 Kent, UK posts: 1 “ Flight cancellation ”

My daughter booked a flight online and paid a £100 deposit with a credit card. She was told the balance had to be paid in cash to a bank account that they would provide details to as she could not pay balance with card because she was travelling one way?

It seemed very suspicious so she emailed to say she wished to cancel and understood they would retain her deposit. They say they AND the airline charge £250 fee.

Since checking with CC company there are TWO charges for whole cost of flight! They have referred it on to their fraud dpt. Nothing in T&C's mentions this -- only that deposit is non-refundable.

Since i got a new flight number for the return flight that would mean that my original flight was cancelled would it not? And if so.. why would there be a penalty on my part if they do that.

What is the better option? Flying on an overnight flight and arriving early in the morning and hoping to get an early check in if not already pre-arranged or day flight and arriving late evening.

Overnight gives you that day to start exploring (regardless of sleep) and do the same coming back,so in theory 2 extra days at your destination which can be important if time is short.

Or the day flight so you get a get a good nights sleep on arrival and start fresh the next morning.

1488,"American Airlines Welcomes All Thieves Aboard!

During my recent overnight AA flight 192 from Los Angeles to Boston, a brazen passenger rummaged through overhead bins, removed my luggage and stole both my Apple iPad and iPhone.

Since I installed Apple’s Mobile Me software with the location finder, I was able to determine the culprit’s street address in South Boston as soon as each device was turned on.

While Google maps showed me that the address was a three-story apartment building, the location finder could not tell me the specific unit number. I contacted Boston Police to report the crime, and they asked me to obtain the passengers name so they could investigate the theft.

I then contacted American’s customer relations department and they informed me that “they could only release the passenger’s name if the police issued a subpoena.”

Ever hear of Catch 22? How can the police issue a subpoena without a name? Customer relations also said their policy doesn't cover any losses from onboard theft, regardless of circumstances.

I then contacted American’s press relations department. They informed me that “overhead bins are public storage spaces to which customers have free access. As with any public place, it is each individual’s personal responsibility to ensure the security of their belongings. We cannot be held responsible for any unattended items reported missing.”

If I'm on an overnight flight, shouldn't I be sleeping instead of guarding ""my"" shared overhead bin? Don't you think American has a responsibility to inform passengers of this – or at least issue some legal disclaimer – during pre-flight instructions?

“Dear passengers, anyone can access your valuables while you are asleep during flight and we will not question them, or be held responsible. Please keep valuables in your possession at all times, or avoid sleeping on overnight flights.”

That would be reassuring, don't you think? It’s very disturbing and hypocritical that American will offer me a $400 voucher if they overbook a flight, and will cover lost baggage up to $3,300, but they will offer no compensation whatsoever for theft that occurred under their watch while I was sleeping on an overnight flight.

Perhaps just as bad, they will not even help me recoup my property, despite me having proof of a person’s whereabouts.

This is a warning that none of your valuables are safe on American, and they will assume no responsibility regardless of circumstances. I’m sure thieves know this, too. And it’s probably safe to say that until American does something about it, others will fall prey to the same pilfering.

That’s my experience and perspective. Please spread the word and share yours.",,False

I posted a couple of days ago asking for the best airline to fly premium economy from New York to Rome. I now know those options are Delta, United, American, & Alitalia (can't really count them).

In doing my research, I'm finding out these airlines and their premium economy aren't really that much better than regular economy. Talked with the family and decided it might be worth it for us to take a connecting flight if we can travel on one of the European airlines with better accommodations.

I am flying with two very tall men who need their leg room. Also this is the first long haul overseas flight for us, longest in the past probably being around 4 hours. So we want to be comfortable! But not pay an arm & a leg for business.

So the thought was why not connect in Paris and spend a day or two there - I mean why not? So was looking at Air France and their premium economy seats which I have read good and bad things about since they don't have a true recline and are fixed shells. Not sure if that will work for us - bad backs.

Now getting to my point... (didn't mean for this to be so long!) I found an article about Open Skies (which is part of British Airways) and their affordable premium plus class which looks awesome in pictures.

It wasn't until almost 18 hours later that we were told that all our remaining flights had been cancelled due to a no show and had to pay out an extra $6000 for new tickets.

We are traveling from Austin, Texas, and based on the research I've done, we could go with either British Airways or Virgin Atlantic once we travel to a major hub, DFW, JFK, or ORD, most likely.

6687,"Our family of 5 went on vacation from Dallas to Fort Lauderdale during the last week of July 2012.

I seriously considered driving to save on money. But that would be over 24 hours in the van with 3 young kids, not counting all the stops we would have to make in between.

So, I decided to give Spirit a try. I had heard all the horror stories about them, so my expectation wasn't very high. All I wanted was to get on a plane at DFW and get to Florida in one piece the same day instead of 24hrs.

*****Customer Service issue 1.
I purchased 5 tickets, and the next day I was reviewing my purchase and to my horror I noticed my first mistake. I accidentally purchased 5 carry on bags instead of 5 check in baggage. Spirit is pretty strict with their refund policy. But I decided to call anyways. customer service was polite but reluctant. Eventually they gave me a full refund on the carry on which I used to purchased 5 check in bags.

*****Customer Service issue 2.
I elected not to pre-purchase seating. I was afraid that we would be spread out and not be seated together. So I wanted to check in online early right at 24hrs before the flight so we could at least be seated as a group. 24 hours came and I went online to check in but the link wasn't there. I called customer service and they told me that since I'm traveling with kids, I could not do online check in, I had to do counter check in at the airport. Again they were polite but in this case gave me the wrong info. The day of travel I looked online and the link was there, but I took their advice and waited till I got to the airport.

*****Traveling Day.
I wanted to be at the airport 3 hours early but things didn't go as planned. We ended up getting to the check out counter right at 5PM and our flight was for 6:45PM. They quickly checked us in and to our surprise we were all seated together 9ABCDE. We were able to quickly get thru security and we boarded and took off on time. The plane wasn't new but everything was clean and we had reclining seats. Something was rattling quite loudly during our takeoff from DFW. But once in the air it was smooth sailing all the way to FLL. The cabin crew was courteous but don't expect any frills. You have to purchase beverages or snacks if you want them Credit Card only no Cash. A can of soda is $3 and a bag of pretzel is $6. If you want something to drink or eat I recommend buying it before boarding. That's what we did.

*****Return Trip.
We got to the airport at 4PM for an 8:25 flight. Plenty of time. At FLL we didn't see any human check in counter for domestic travel. We had to use an automated check in counter. They have lots of them at FLL. I'm guessing at least 20. They have a customer service agent assigned for a set number of machines. She was very friendly and actually did it for us. the machine automatically spits out 5 boarding passes together. 17ABCDE. The plane was a brand new Airbus A320. Very comfortable seats, but they don't recline and they are close together. The flight was smooth and uneventful which is a good thing. Smooth sailing for 2 1/2 hours until we landed. We took off on time.

*****Rating.
All in all I would have to give Spirit an A. Given my expectation everything went as well as the big boys. So no complaints from me. I would definitely fly them again.

*****Advice.
-If flying as a family in our case 5, in pays to purchase the $9 fare club. It saved us a lot on luggage.
-Spirit has more rules than most airlines, so make sure you know what you're getting into. Use their rules to your advantage and you can save big on the price of a ticket.
-I'm short 5'8 so that wasn't a problem for me, but if you're a really tall person, or hefty you may want to pay extra for the big seats upfront.
-Last but not least give yourself plenty of time for this airline.

Good Luck.",,False

3) More of a query - but my baggage allowance is 3x23kg, my wife's 2x23kg and my son gets a stroller plus 10kg. The operating carrier on the TRR-CMB leg is Cinnamon air, and their fleet seems entirely comprised of 8 seater Cessna 208's.

If everyone brings their full allowance, it seems unlikely that it's all going to fit! Would they prioritise luggage in order of distance flown?

6974,"Hi

My husband and I are off to the States next August. The ONLY thing that is non-negotiable is that we have to be in Salt Lake City on day X for a 7 night coach tour, returning to Salt Lake City for the flight home to the UK. And we may decide to stay an extra day SLC before flying home.

Just because we can, we'd like also to spend a week beforehand in Las Vegas (Grand Canyon etc). And just because, well, why not, we are also considering a few days that would mean flying into Cincinnati to see a couple of things that are of interest. This part we can ditch if it's too difficult to plan / bumps the price up too much. It's just a 'nice to do if poss'.

And no, I don't plan on going back to the States after this, since my holiday wish list already covers the next 10 years! But anyway...

1. I have an assumption in my head that it would be cheaper to fly from the UK to the same US city that we would fly home to rather than open-jaw / multi city. Am I right in thinking this?

2. Based on the above assumption, that it would then be cheaper for me to sort out the internal flights separately as I would then have more choice of airlines incl. the domestic airlines

3. There are too many combinations and it's doing my head in! eg Fly to SLC and from there to LAS to CVG to SLC or...SLC / CVG / LAS / SLC or.... fly from uk to LAS / CVG / SLC or ...hmm, I don't think I want to do UK to CVG as there are no direct flights, I believe.

4. I'm beginning to think LAS / CVG / SLC ( but is it then better to fly back to LAS for the return to the UK, or is the price difference not that great if I fly into one and out from another?)

5. If you have the slightest notion of what I'm going on about, I salute you, and thank you for any thoughts you may have that would help clarify things for me. I think it's just that because outside of the specific coach tour, we have no fixed plans, no fixed timescales and can go here, there and everywhere! I would like to go premium economy (or whisper it; if a sale comes up and we can find a business fare...! I only care about that UK to USA and back again.

7086,"Hi,

I could do with some advice on booking flights and travel for a fortnight in South Africa in August '11.

First the long haul flights from London. It seems like decades since I booked a flight to anywhere except Europe or the USA so I am not up to date. My fellow traveller is pretty much convinced we should get down to the nearest London travel agent or click on South African Airways right away (January), on the grounds that tickets will go up or flights sell out. Then it's done.

I reckon it could be worth waiting a bit. Do air fare prices drop significantly? Is it too early to hunt for a better deal, and what are the best search engines and web sites to check? How long should I wait?

Secondly, any advice on internal flights or other transport from Cape Town to Jo'burg? We plan a few days in CT and then go on to Kruger National Park. There is no way, incidentally, that we are going to wait until the last minute and hope for a cut price deal a week before departure. No way. Absolutely no way no matter how much cheaper.

We see a chance to book them flying from Tokyo to Munich (via Moscow) and flight is actually a code share with JAL for the Tokyo-Moscow leg, and then S7 for Moscow-Munich.

My concern is not the price (at about 950 dollars that is as cheap as you can find this late flying to Europe), but rather the payment process. You need to book through S7's website, where you will be billed in roubles.

On thing is, I am not sure what the exchange rate might be (though at this price, hould be negligible), and I understand we would qualify for air miles within the One World group.

I was just wondering if anyone has booked longer haul tickets with S7 and had any problems, etc. I saw a few people had problems, but usually with the domestic flights within in Russia (S7 is the largest domestic carrier in Russia).

our flight from Ireland arrives in Manchester T1 and we have a layover of 3.5 hours before our US flight leaves from T2. From what I have read here it should only take 15 mins to get T2 from T1.

My questions are....

1. Do we have to clear security again when changing terminals (as you do in Heathrow and can be a very long wait)

2. Could we get breakfast in T1 (giraffe) and still have enough time to get to T2. Breakfast options in T2 don't seem as good for the kids (I supposed this depends on the answer to my first question). 

3. Would it be worthwhile booking an Escape lounge in T2 so we could just chill out and have brekkie there before our US flight.

I am not sure what trick they are playing but it sure is a trick.

I did this rigmarole with 3 people and as it was costing me a lot on my mobile I thought I would try on Chat on their website - surprisingly they managed to do the same scam over chat too. As I was very frustrated I droppedtge chat.

So when things go wrong, Ebookers are lousy. Also it is not easy to understand the accent of the call centre operators.

To start with, they are low cost only selectively, basically on routes where there is meaningful competition. To Malaga for example, the price per ticket is €350, not exactly low cost, and not so different from what 'classic' airlines charge.

Now to service: The flight to Malaga was delayed 4hr 58 min, basically 2 minutes less than the limit according to European regulation, that would require a ticket refund. Maybe a coincidence? I don't think so..

For a variety of reasons we de decided to no longer fly to Malaga because of the delay. We asked for the refund from their 'customer service'. We were told that the 2min less than 5hrs meant they owed us nothing.

We appealed, they ignored our communication. We asked to speak to a manager, we were never referred to one. We wrote to the CEO Alex Cruz, he never replied.

- Air Asia decided to fly out of sydney 80 minutes before curfew. Didnt make it. We were stranded. Noone was answering the phone. Tough luck. Hotel at our expense. The cheap flight was beginnning to cost us against other airlines who take responsibility for you.

- We booked through expedia. Went to check in. We werent sitting together. $30 to sit together. This isnt low cost its hidden cost.

- We specified my wifes vegetarian preference when booking. We thought that meant food. We were wrong. - You have to preorder food. For a nine hour flight do you have any choice? This isnt low cost its hidden cost. They dont allow you to bring food or drink on board

- What is worse they serve the food as soon as you take off. On the return journey I asked for my breakfast to be served before we got into sydney. Sure they said. When it arrived it had been in the warmer all night. Inedible. Baked beans dry and crusted.

- The woman next to us started throwing up. The staff avoided coming anywhere near us instead of offering help. - On one leg they started aggressively selling thier onboard merchandise. He may as well have had a megaphone. Awful experience. Multiple sales pitches.

- In KL they use an old airline building where the toilets are either squat or have a pipe coming out of the cistern (close the lid before flushing)

- Departing from KL we were herded into a holding room for an hour. You have to sit on the floor as there just arent the seats.

Recommendations-

- dont take a last flight out of anywhere as every flight we took was late

- dont fly more than 4 hours. You wont eat.

- look carefully at the price. Compare them against airlines who will take care of you if you get stranded and dont spring extra charges.

When I finally got the plane's seating map it came on without the seats!!! It would only accept one passenger at a time although they were on the same code number. It took me 3 hours!

This may be a silly question, we have booked with Thomson and are flying out on the Dreamliner next month from Glasgow. We initially paid for economy however, thought I would give them a phone today as would like to upgrade to premium, however have been advised that there are no seats but could try again three days before we leave as there may be seats available due to cancellation and when I asked about return flights they said to contact them nine days before we are due to return home.

Do they normally keep premium seats back until the last few days before the plane is due to leave? and is there someone I can email to contact regarding upgrading or am I best to phone and keep trying to get something

I am thinking of booking a couple of connecting international flights through Vayama (nyc - london - naples). I am aware of the risks of dealing with their customer service and limitations on tickets bought through third party consolidators and don't expect any need to make any changes etc...

However, I have seen several posts on the scenario where purchased tickets are later cancelled by the airline and of course all the consolidator is able to do is offer alternative flights for purchase (cannot simply switch flights because theyre not a travel agent/airline etc) that may exceed the cost of the original booking.

Is anyone aware of any travel insurance that would cover the cost difference of having to rebook at a higher price due to flight cancellation?

Additionally would that insurance also cover arrangements if connecting flights are missed (assuming the first leg is cancelled/full and the connection cannot be made)? I can purchase either UK or US insurance (UK citizen, US resident).

a few quick questions. My mom and I are going to China next month. While in China, our 4 domestic flights will be on Air China in economy. We are both Star Alliance Gold-equivalent (she thru Miles and More, me thru United).

- The Air China web site is a little confusing about baggage. I know we are normally allowed one piece of 20 kgs each in economy. What is the extra baggage allowance - is it by weight or piece?

I have a question regarding my seating on an upcoming flight. I will be flying Delta 582 from Shanghai, Pudong Airport to Detroit Metro Airport. On this flight, I will be on a 747-400 plane.

My question is this...

I notice that in the general economy seating, specifically rows 63, 64 and 65, the wing rows seat only two people and the plane itself tapers off. Would those be better seats in terms of leg room, if I book the window seats?

Outside of that, is there a seat that anyone could recommend for me, economy or economy comfort, given my size?

Ideally I would like the emergency exit seating, but those don't open up until check in, and my flight is more than 3 months off.

Looking for some information regarding airlines from Vancouver to Eurpoe - - which carriers are the most comfortable waiting breaking the bank?

We are in the beginning stages of planning our first European vacation for 2 weeks in Aug 2011 - which means our first long haul flight.

We have flown the smaller aircrafts domestically and down to Mexico and the Caribbean and find after 5 - 6 hours in the cattle cars our limits have been reached and often comment how anyone can stand to fly economy on long haul flights.

From what I see on seat guru the seat width’s and pitches in economy are comparable if not worse than the domestic carriers we have used to go to Mexico/Caribbean.

I am totally confused as to my baggage limit on a forthcoming trip. I have booked to travel from Perth to Los Angeles on the Australian site of American Airlines. I travel via Japan, my flight from Perth, Australia to Tokyo is with QANTAS as a codeshare and then with A.A. from Tokyo to Los Angeles 

I have read conflicting reports as to my baggage allowance.

Looking at one website I thought my allowance was 2 bags at 50lbs/23kgs. Then looking at www.luggagelimits.com it seems to be just one bag. Also, I shall be ckecking in with Qantas where the carry on limit is 5 kgs. With A.A. it appears to be 18 kgs.

Do I get 5kgs or 18kgs?

What about on my return trip?

I can take 18 kgs on at Los Angeles but what happens when I change planes at Tokyo? It seems that A.A. have different allowances depending on what country or continent your trip begins in, ends in, passes through on route and your final destination!

Asking about carry on sizes and if anyone has used the Joy Mangano TravelEase color-block double-decker duffle yet. Just bought and was assured it is 'carry on' multiple times. Many reviewers claim they had to check it. I checked carry on sizes and airlines I use standard is 22x14x9 = 44inches. Hers is 21x10x15.5 = 46.5inches. But...and here is the second question, in checking other brands of carry ons, many are over by an inch or two.

So, how much ""leeway"" do you really have with carry on size? (I know sometimes small regionals need to stow even the carry on size, I'm talking the typical major airline flights).

Also, if you have experience with the specific luggage mentioned, did it go carry on and how is the ease of use?

7495,"I've tried to look around for an answer, but figured asking directly is the easiest.

Here is the dilemma:

My friend and I are planning a trip together for June. We will be visiting Paris for a few days, with a day stopover in Dubai, then taking a safari in Kenya. He is currently working in the middle east and will be coming to the US to visit first, then flying to Paris from New York.

His company is paying for his flight from New York to Paris, then Paris to Dubai. These flights have already been booked. I will be traveling from Florida, hopefully linking up with him in New York to fly together to Paris, then we will fly together to Dubai.

The flights from Dubai to Nairobi, then Nairobi back home, are not supplied by his company, so we figured we could book those together online.

The question I have is -- how do I create an itinerary from Florida to New York to Paris to Dubai, making sure I end up on the same flights as him for the NY, Paris, and Dubai legs?

I have tried to look online for the same flights but nothing is letting me specify certain flights for certain legs and link them all into one itinerary, without purchasing a bunch of one-way single tickets, which I imagine would be a nightmare as a far as checking bags, getting boarding passes, etc.

Am I going to have to use a travel agent to book these all together? And how can I link up with my friend's itinerary so that if a flight is changed or cancelled, we will both be rerouted to the same place?

I am sure this is a simple thing and I am just over thinking; I have had plenty of experience flying domestically and buying tickets online, but not internationally and not when booking tickets separately.

6543,"This week I made a day trip on Air Berlin from (London) Stansted to Nuremberg, as I have done several times before.

Indeed I have travelled through STN many times on different airlines. Not my favourite, but good enough.

Anyway, this trip, I parked in the red short stay, furthest away from the terminal. I don't mind walking the extra 100 yds and I loathe driving round looking for a space. This is where I usually park. On my return to STN, I paid for the car park in the baggage hall. I usually do this if available - it saves queuing later, or finding that the machines are broken, again. Time on my receipt, 19:06. I went straight to my car. Not running, but not crawling either. changed my shoes & jacket. I started the engine. I waited for the screen to clear. I set off. A routine I have followed many times. I got to the barrier, fed it with my ticket, and waited. And waited. AND WAITED.

So I looked at the display, which boldly told me that a payment of £2.50 was due. At this point, seeting and desperate to escape, I used the pay at barrier facility, which was miraculously working.

Time on receipt: 19:28. Now I don't think 22 minutes is unreasonable to take to find the car and get to the barrier. I have taken far longer on occassion when I have forgotten where I have parked. So what is going on STN?

This behaviour is either a mistake or an intentional revenue stream. Either way, it is unacceptable, and I thought I should share it with the World before I take it up with you because I have had it up to here with poor service and I want everyone to know that you have found a hithertoo unknown way in which to suck.

6590,"I was hoping that some personal experience might help us to make this decision.

We're looking at travelling to New Zealand in April 2013 and had initially thought of going via LAX and booking the Sky Couch.

However, I’ve read a lot of horror stories about the transit experience in LA so from that perspective would prefer to go via Hong Kong – obviously no Sky Couch that way, so Premium Economy enters the mix.

Having had a hellish experience flying in Cathay Pacific’s economy spaceseats we are very keen to avoid Air NZ’s new Premium Economy, but I think I’m right in saying that the planes on the HK route still have the old version?

Questions is Sky Couch good enough to override the poor transfer experience at LAX? (My husband is 6’1” and very broad in the shoulders, if that makes any difference) how much does it actually cost? (Economy for 2 on the desired flights would be about £2,700)

given the choice, would you go for Sky Couch or old-style Premium Economy? is there any danger the new fleet will be rolled out to the HK route in the next 10 months, leaving us stuck with spaceseats?

I wasn't sure where to put this question, it seems this is probably the best place to start, but please direct me elsewhere if there's somewhere else i should ask this!

I'm travelling to Malaysia with Malaysian airlines in May from LHR on a 12 hour flight. I suffer quite badly from irritable bowl syndrome. I've flown a lot as we love to travel and in general not had many problems, mainly because i've taken medication in advance to help calm/stop any symptoms before they start!

However, on a flight to Thailand in December last year I was quite ill, I think it was possibly something I'd eaten and unfortunately was stuck on a 6 hour flight with an upset stomach.

Thankfully, I was able to get to the bathrooms ok, but was a bit panicked when the seat belt sign went on. Ever since then i've been suffering with anxiety relating to travel, even car travel.

We went to Reykjavik over new years and i almost didn't get on the plane as I'd got so anxious it set off my IBS and I was being ill. Eventually I calmed down and was ok for the rest of the flight. 

My counsellor has suggested looking into whether i can specify seats near the toilets, and also looking into how airlines deal with waste on board so in the worst case scenario I'd be prepared and can plan for this, which would hopefully would make me a little more calm getting on the plane as I'd could reassure myself.

Does anyone know where i'd contact to discuss such request and having my seat nearer the toilets? 

I've looked on malaysian airlines website and there is a contact number but it seems to be in Malaysia.

Do I contact this number or the staff at LHR at the malaysian desk there?

I'm flying US Airways from Minneapolis to Phoenix and then a regional to Fresno.

We only have a 40 minute layover. I purchased Choice seats in order to be able to get on sooner and be nearer the front of the plane when we arrive. I had a choice of two aisle seats in row 12 or an aisle and a middle in row 7. I took the aisle 12 but am thinking of switching to aisle 7.

My fiancee and I will be visiting Peru this July on our honeymoon.

We will start off in Lima, before heading to Cusco, walking the Inca Trail, then heading to Puerto Maldonado and staying in an Amazon lodge, before flying back to Lima and then home.

I want to use Star Peru for the internal flights, mainly due to price and reasonable reviews. Our flight home from Lima is booked for early Sunday morning, so I thought that we would travel from PM to Lima on Friday.

I've found that there is only one flight per day with Star Peru (flight 1182) at 11:45, arriving in Lima by 14:30. However, looking at …flightmapper.net/flight/Star_Peru_2I_1182 it appears that the flight has a 45 minute stop in Cusco on the way.

i'm italian and this summer I would travel in America, visiting (in this order) Canada, USA, Messico and (could be) some central - south America countries.

I'm having problem to understand the entering/exiting USA through the Visa Waiver Program in my specific case (I read a lot of topic here, all the USA official website, wrote to embassies... but still is not clear to me).

So i try to post here for some suggestions.

I already have a flight to Canada, where i'll stay 15-30 days. Then my intention is to get to USA under Visa Waiver Program *by land border* (not requiring ESTA > http://goo.gl/THCxbx), spending 45-60 days there.

Then moving again *by land border* to Mexico, spending there some more days (still unknown) Once in Mexico i'll decide if to fly back to Italy or to go more south (like Brazil) and from there flying back to Italy.

So at the moment i've no booked ticket except the arrival in Canada, and for me the best would be booking my next flights once in Mexico, since i'll decide there what to do next and when.

According to the US law entering *by land* the onward/return ticket is not required > http://goo.gl/irXoFR But I have the doubt that also if the onward/return ticket is not a requirement, I think having that could represent for the the Border Officer a strong clue of my intention of NOT remaining illegally in USA (that is anyway not my real intention).

So I'm in trouble if considering more the ""written law"" (i don't need a onward ticket entering by land) or considering more the crucial opinion of the Border Officer that could perceive me as a ""potential cheater"" by the clues he could get from interviewing me (""Do you have a job/a boss waiting for you in Italy?"" Me: ""No, i'm on sabbatic"" - ""Do you have a wife/partner/child waiting for you in Italy?"" Me: ""No, I'm single"" - ""Do you have a precise itinerary and onward/return ticket?"" Me: ""No, I'll decide once in Mexico"" - ""Seems you don't have strong ties to Italy neither a onward/return ticket... go back, you could be a cheater wanting to stay illegally in USA"").

Since I'm not a lier, I cannot modify my first 2 answer, So I want to understand if would be safer to buy a onward/return flight corresponding to the most probable itinerary I can guess now I'll want to do or I can trust the law that says is not needed.

And eventually which onward/return ticket would be enough:

- USA to Mexico (by bus)
- Mexico to Belize or Guatemala
- Mexico to Italy (eventually open)

PR' faces competition from QANTAS that flies once a week direct from Brisbane to Manila and return, but QANTAS does not have any flights to Manila from Perth or Darwin (except for its subsidiary Jetstar as above).

PR tried running Manila - Melbourne - Brisbane - Manila twice a week a couple of years ago but pulled out of servicing Brisbane a few months later.

Are these 'one stop' flights ex Manila likely to be reasonably successful (depending on price) or do Filipinos, Australians and others mostly prefer travelling via Singapore, Hong Kong or Sydney on one stop or direct flights to Australia?

Is the need of the Airbus to stop in Darwin a disincentive to use it, notwithstanding that with a competitor such as Singapore Airlines or Cathay Pacific one has to change planes ex Manila in Singapore or Hong Kong directly, sometimes with reasonably long connections?

6524,"Hi

I have booked a flight with ebookers from dublin to new york. There is a stop over in london (dublin-london-new york). The flight dublin-london is with a different airline to that from london-new york.

I am now, more than likely, not going to need the dublin-london flight.

I know that usually, if you were not to take the first leg of a flight, the airline would cancel the remaining flights. However, as mentioned, the two airlines are different, I'm just not sure whether they will liase with each other and my london-new york flight will be cancelled?!

I have tried calling ebookers but they lady on the telephone did not seem to understand my question.

Thanks, J",,False
6560,"I'm planning a flight to Vienna, Austria (VIE). I'm coming from Dallas (DFW) on American Airlines landing into Frankfurt (FRA) Terminal 2 Area E and catching a flight on Air Berlin to Vienna from Frankfurt (FRA) Terminal 2 Area E.

Assumptions:

1. no baggage check-in (i'm carrying on all my bags on the plane so no need to pick up)

2. flights are on time if not earlier

3. coach seatting on a 777

4. online/web check-in

Flight details:

DFW -> FRA: lands at 8:30 am (american airlines lands Terminal 2 Area E)
FRA -> VIE: flight departs at 9:25am (air berlin departs Terminal 2 Area E)

if you take this information and you have a roller bag (no check-in baggage), is this possible to make this connection or will i lose my ticket money?

Has anyone ever done this before?

Do i have to go outside and then back inside frankfurt airport or any weird nuances of frankfurt airport?

Any insight would be greatly appreciated!

According to the American Airlines website: “When schedule changes are implemented by American Airlines that are unacceptable to the customer and result in a change of 61-120 minutes, the customer is eligible to receive a voucher for the ticket value.”

I’m not sure what this means, can anyone explain? The website also says, “For schedule changes of more than 120 minutes, the customer is eligible to receive a refund to original form of payment.”

We are currently exploring options to get from New Orleans to Philadelphia on 01 Jan 2017 and flights are very expensive for obvious reasons.

There are only a few direct flights and they are ridiculously pricey. There are indirect flights via different destinations but they are still pricey.

I figured we could look for a cheap flight to Washington and then hop on a bus or get a family friend to collect us from there instead. However, when I did this, I have found a VERY well priced flight to Washington ($240), indirect, but VIA PHL?! So confusing.

Flights to PHL are double/triple the price than if you book Washington via PHL. What I wanted to know, is if I book these flights, can we simply just hop out at PHL and miss the onward connection? 

We will have luggage checked in. Do we collected our bags domestically or would they be tagged and transferred across to the next flight automatically?",,False

so, I booked flights from Helsinki to Miami via American Airlines, but the carriers on my way back from Miami are first BA and then from Heathrow to Helsinki Finnair.

As BA´s hand baggage restrictions are very traveller-friendly and Finnair´s are miserly, here´s my question:

Will anyone re-weigh my hand baggage on Heathrow?

Can anyone tell me for sure? Do I get away with a 10 - kilo hand baggage boarding Finnair on Heathrow if the luggage is the correct size for Finnair (smaller than BA, naturally.)

BA would allow hand baggage up to 23 kilos, incredible! :O)

6721,"I've booked a flight with United Airlines from Toronto to Australia. I have to make two connections in the US, which means I'd clear American customs in Canada. All of the flights are with United. The first leg of the trip is Toronto to Chicago.

Once I land in Chicago I'll have 60 minutes to board a flight to LAX, but I won't have to leave terminal 1. The second leg of the trip is Chicago to LAX. Once I land in LAX I only have 50 minutes to board the connecting flight to Australia. However, as with the first leg, it's in the same terminal.

Is this a decent enough time to give myself to make the two connections? I can't imagine the walk would be more than 5 minutes between gates within the same terminal.

I'd also imagine that there would be a fair number of people making the Toronto-Chicago-LAX flight with me.
